The “make” program in Linux is used to compile and manage a set of source code applications and files. It allows developers to install and gather a range of apps via the terminal. It also controls and cuts down on the amount of time necessary for compilation. The basic objective of the make command is to break down a large program into smaller chunks and determine if it needs to be recompiled. It also has all of the necessary instructions for recompiling them. In this article, we will be installing the make program on the Ubuntu system.
Makefile sets a set of rules to determine which parts of a program need to be recompile, and issues command to recompile them. • Makefile is a way of automating software building procedure and other complex tasks with dependencies. • Makefile contains: dependency rules, macros and suffix(or implicit) rules.
When make recompiles the editor, each changed C source file must be recompiled. If a header file has changed, each C source file that includes the header file must be recompiled to be safe. Each compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file. Finally, if any source file has been recompiled, all the object files, whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked together to produce the new executable editor.
